## February 9

We will use the following shebang from now on, as it was recommended.
`#!/usr/bin/env bash`

We set up branch protection of the main branch.

- Require pull requests with approvals: Such that people do not push "wrong" code. Until we have functional status checks, this is necessary.
- Require status checks to pass before merge: Such that people do not push code that breaks our project. We do not have any checks yet.
- Only allow squash merge for pull requests: For a cleaner history in our repository
