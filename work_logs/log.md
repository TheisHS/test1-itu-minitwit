## February 9

We will use the following shebang from now on, as it was recommended.
`#!/usr/bin/env bash`

We set up branch protection of the main branch.

- Require pull requests with approvals: Such that people do not push "wrong" code. Until we have functional status checks, this is necessary.
- Require status checks to pass before merge: Such that people do not push code that breaks our project. We do not have any checks yet.
- Only allow squash merge for pull requests: For a cleaner history in our repository

### Feature mapping of ITU Minitwit

- Connect to the database
- Create the database tables
- Query the database

- Fromat a timestamp for display
- Get a gravatar image for an email
- Before a request, it connects to the DB and gets the user, and after a request it closes the connection to the DB.

- Routes:
  - A route to follow other users
  - A route to unfollow other users
  - A route for adding messages
  - A route to register
  - A route to login

Crystal Kemal vs. Ruby Sinatra

**Decision** We will go with Crystal Kemal.

## Feb 13

We have decided to change language from Crystal + Kemal to Go. Reason for this is that Crystal and especially Kemal lacks documentation to a point where it becomes almost impossible to work with. The reasoning for Go is that it matches Crystal in the comparison sheet we made, while having a lot more documentation.

Initial refactor (setup connections, middleware and declare endpoints) was done together on one screen. With a setup that worked, we split up the work by dividing the different functionalities between group members. We created a local environment (.env) with a SESSION_KEY that all members of the group should have locally, because we do not want to push any secrets to the repository. We can also mirror the Flask session using a Gorilla library for sessions. Additionally we are using the Gorilla mux library for routing.

We thought of TDD when refactoring to Go and the needed tests.
